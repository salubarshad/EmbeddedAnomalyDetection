# AI-based Anomaly Detection for Embedded Systems

This project implements an AI-based anomaly detection system, designed to be used with embedded systems like the **ESP32**. The system uses machine learning techniques to detect anomalies in sensor data, which could be useful in applications such as **IoT**, **predictive maintenance**, and **real-time monitoring**.

## Project Overview

This project is designed to detect anomalies in sensor data using a machine learning model. The system follows a **three-step process**:

1. **Data Generation**: Synthetic sensor data is generated to simulate real-world sensor input.
2. **Model Training**: A machine learning model is trained using the generated data to detect anomalies.
3. **Model Testing**: The trained model is tested on a set of data to check its accuracy and predictions.

## Technologies Used

- **Python**: The primary programming language used to implement data generation, model training, and testing.
- **Scikit-learn**: A Python library used for training machine learning models like Random Forest.
- **Numpy**: Used for numerical operations, particularly for data manipulation and feature engineering.
- **Matplotlib**: Used for data visualization during exploratory data analysis and model evaluation.

## Data Generation

The first step of the project involves generating synthetic sensor data that mimics real-world sensor inputs. This data is created using random number generation and is saved to a file for further processing.

### Key Details:
- The data is generated as a text file (`sensor_data.txt`) with random values.
- Each entry in the data represents a sensor reading that could be used for anomaly detection in a system like IoT.
  
Run the `generate_data.py` script to generate the synthetic data:

```bash
python scripts/generate_data.py
```

## Model Training

Once the data is generated, the next step is to train a machine learning model on this data. In this case, we are using a Random Forest classifier, which is known for handling anomaly detection tasks well.

### Training Process:
- The data is loaded from the sensor_data.txt file.
- A Random Forest model is trained to predict anomalies in the sensor readings.
- The trained model is saved to a file (anomaly_model.pkl) for future use.

Run the train_model.py script to train the model:

```bash
python scripts/train_model.py
```

## Model Testing

After training the model, it's important to test its performance on unseen data. This is where the modelâ€™s accuracy and reliability are evaluated.

The testing script will load the trained model and apply it to a test dataset, providing predictions for each sensor reading.

### Testing Process:
- The trained model is loaded from the saved .pkl file.
- Test data is passed to the model, which returns predictions indicating whether each reading is an anomaly or normal.
- The results are printed to the console, displaying the sensor readings and their corresponding status.

Run the test_model.py script to test the model:

```bash
python scripts/test_model.py
```

## Usage

To use this project, follow the steps below:

1. Generate synthetic sensor data by running:
```bash
python scripts/generate_data.py
```
2. Train the anomaly detection model:
```bash
python scripts/train_model.py
```
3. Test the model's performance:
```bash
python scripts/test_model.py
```

Once these steps are completed, the model will be trained and tested, with results displayed on the console.
